question : grid bag layout in java . 

explanation : 
              first we import java swing package and java awt package 
              then after we take a class and define it as a public 
              then here we take ja frame conatiner object 
              afetr that we define a constructor in which we create an object of a j frame class 
              after that we create 9 button . 
              by function j butoon and adding refrence variable to btn1 with button name as 1 . 
              so as the horizontal panel . then we specify the position of a button by 
              gridx = 0 ;
              grid y = 0;
              and add this fucntion to button 1 and the same goes for each button 
              . in button 3 we use ipady function which specify internal padding like how much to add to the size of the component 
              .
              the default value is zero .

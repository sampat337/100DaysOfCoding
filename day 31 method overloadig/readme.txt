question : show method overloading in java 

explanation : first we define a class met over in which i take a mothod name void show ()
              in which i declare a variable c ,a,b in which i assigned the value of a = 10 and b=20
              and done some arithmatic operation c=a+b  .
              after that i take another method with same name void show()
              in which i declare the int x,int y as a separate entity 
              also ill take another method with same name void show()
              in which i declare the double x,int y and done some operation and store the result in c 
              after then ill declare the main method in which i create the obeject of method 
              r.show()
              and then in initilizing the method ill assign the value of it in method show .like 
              r.show();
              r.show(34,56);
              r.show(24.5,65);
              
input case : int x = 34 , int y = 56;
             double x = 24.5 , y = 65;
             
output case :  30
               90
               89.5

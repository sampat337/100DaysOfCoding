  question : show contructor overloading
  
  explanation :
     
       whwnever we have more than one contructor in a class we called it as a contructor overloading .
       int he program first we have taken a class constructor in which ive decalrared a variable int a 
       double b , and string c .  first we take a contructor() . in which ive define the varible a = 10 , b = 20.5
       , and c = "sampat" . 
       after that ive taken aother contructor with the same name and pass the value int x in it .
       then in that ive declared the value a = x .
        after that ive taken another contructor in which i passed the value double y , string z .
         then in that method ive declared the b = y , c = z ;
          then ive taken the main function in which i have created an object with refrence varible of earch contructor and pass the value in it . 
            then i print all the value of contructor . 
            
            
     output :  10 20.5 sampat
               100 
               200 aman

/* Java Instanceof keyword


The Java instanceof operator is used to test if the object or instance is an instanceof the specified type.
In this problem we have given you three classes in the editor, Student, Rockstar and Hacker. In the main 
function we populated an ArrayList with instances of these classes. count method counts how many instance of each 
type are present in the ArrayList. Some lines of the code are missing, and you have to fix it by modifying only 3 lines!
To restore the original code in the editor, click on the top left icon in the editor and create a new buffer.

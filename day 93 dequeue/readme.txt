/*


Deque or Double Ended Queue is a type of queue in which insertion and removal of 
elements can either be performed from the front or the rear. 
Thus, it does not follow FIFO rule (First In First Out).

Representation of Deque
Types of Deque
Input Restricted Deque
In this deque, input is restricted at a single end but allows deletion at both the ends.
Output Restricted Deque
In this deque, output is restricted at a single end but allows insertion at both the ends.
Operations on a Deque
Below is the circular array implementation of deque. In a circular array, 
if the array is full, we start from the beginning.

But in a linear array implementation, if the array is full, 

no more elements can be inserted. In each of the operations below,
if the array is full, "overflow message" is thrown.

Before performing the following operations, these steps are followed.

Take an array (deque) of size n.
Set two pointers at the first position and set front = -1 and rear = 0.
initialize an array and pointers for deque operations
Initialize an array and pointers for deque
1. Insert at the Front
This operation adds an element at the front.

Check the position of front.
check the position of front
Check the position of front
If front < 1, reinitialize front = n-1 (last index).
if front is less than 1 shift front to the end
Shift front to the end
Else, decrease front by 1.
Add the new key 5 into array[front].
Insert element at the position of front
Insert the element at Front
2. Insert at the Rear
This operation adds an element to the rear.

Check if the array is full.
check if deque is full
Check if deque is full
If the deque is full, reinitialize rear = 0.
Else, increase rear by 1.
if deque is not full increase rear
Increase the rear
Add the new key 5 into array[rear].
insert element at the rear
Insert the element at rear
3. Delete from the Front

The operation deletes an element from the front.

Check if the deque is empty.
check if deque is empty
Check if deque is empty
If the deque is empty (i.e. front = -1), deletion cannot be performed (underflow condition).
If the deque has only one element (i.e. front = rear), set front = -1 and rear = -1.
Else if front is at the end (i.e. front = n - 1), set go to the front front = 0.
Else, front = front + 1.
increase the index of front
Increase the front
4. Delete from the Rear
This operation deletes an element from the rear.

Check if the deque is empty.
check if deque is empty
Check if deque is empty
If the deque is empty (i.e. front = -1), deletion cannot be performed (underflow condition).
If the deque has only one element (i.e. front = rear), set front = -1 and rear = -1, 
else follow the steps below.
If rear is at the front (i.e. rear = 0), set go to the front rear = n - 1.
Else, rear = rear - 1.
decrease the position of rear
Decrease the rear
5. Check Empty
This operation checks if the deque is empty. If front = -1, the deque is empty.

6. Check Full
This operation checks if the deque is full. If front = 0 and rear = n - 1 OR 
front = rear + 1, the deque is full.

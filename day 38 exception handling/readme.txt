 explanation : 
              You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator.
              Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int).
              This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds n^p.
              If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative".
              Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should not be zero"


Sample Input :      3 5
                    2 4
                    0 0
                   -1 -2
                   -1  3

expected output : 243
                  16
                  java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.
                  java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
                  java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative

output :  243
          16
          java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.
          java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
          java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
